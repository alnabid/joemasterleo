            <h1>The Ambient Christ</h1>
            <p> We live in an age hungry for a new universe story, a grand cosmology that reconciles the Creation Story with Evolution, scientific understanding with religion.
            <br> Such a narrative, if viable, would combine two separate cosmologies, religious and scientific, into one; mythically, “The Greatest Story Never Told,” a subtitle once considered for this book.
            <br> I like to think big thoughts. In the seventh decade of life, I find myself in what Erik Erikson called the Generative Stage, the next to last stage of psychosocial development.
            <br> It’s that time of life when a person is inspired, nay impelled to give something of value in gratitude for the benefit of future generations.
            <br> For seers, especially writers, such involves offering clarity of vision and direction to those who follow.
            <br> This book contains what I deem the most valuable and enduring perspective(s) gleaned from experience and the vocation for which I was gifted and called.
            <br> Every moment and experience in my life, every disappointment, failure, frustration, and success has led to its making.
            <br> Its content is not for everyone, not even for most, though a few may find it relevant or enlightening.
            <br> It is born of my passionate curiosity about the inner workings of things, whose origin is in deepest nature, the One from which the many are derived.
            <br> In all division, argument, and conflict, all sides are usually more dominated by error than by reality.
            <br> That is because the only reality that could be present, were it present, would prevent or resolve the conflict, dissolve the division, and/or end the argument.
            <br> There could be no conflict if all participated in that reality, or the focused intent to pursue same toward that end.
            <br> Deficient by nature in the earnest and peaceful pursuit of same, most mortals attempt this by means of argument, each believing his siloed idea is valid.
            <br> By observing all division and conflict over a lifetime, none more fervent than between creationism and evolution, religion and science, it is painfully obvious that reality (the infallible) has yet to be substantively revealed to either faction.
            <br> This book is an attempt to end that conflict, and all conflicts where differences are preferred, sought, and defended over those of commonality, civility, and union.
            <br> While the grand synthesis proposed herein claims no infallibility, it points in the direction where its mysteries may be discovered in nature and supernature, hidden in plain sight, visible only to eyes prepared to see them.

            <p> There is an unfilled field in the cosmos that holds everything together, and every discipline is a portal to it.
            <br> Science calls it a field of fundamental forces and elementary particles.
            <br> Religion calls it God and accepts it by faith as an impenetratable mystery.
            <br> How can their unbending perspectives be conciled?
            <br> In The Ambient Christ, the author proposes a novel paradigm that explains their complementarity as a seamless unity.
            <br> This innovative model provides a new story for an ailing and divided planet in the twenty-first century, and a viable solution to the holy grail quest.
            <br><br> "There is something to narrow and missing in gospel as it is presented to us.
            <br> In spite of appearences, our age is more religious than ever; it only needs stronger meat"
            <br> ~Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
            <br><br> "A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificance of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by conventional faiths.
            <br> Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge."
            <br> ~Carl Sagan

        <h1>Biography: <br> About the Author</h1>
        <p> Joseph C. Masterleo, LCSW-DCSW, is a clinical social worker in private practice in Syracuse, NY and Rockledge, FL.
        <br> His half-century of service in the mental health care field includes faith-based counseling, with an emphasis on psycho-spiritual integration.
        <br> His subspecialty involves developing a novel paradigm for the synthesis of science, religion, and psychology, identifying the energy and geometric patterns that connect the quantum world with space-time.
        <br> His model explains how spirit and matter can co-exist as two facets of one reality in a unified field, dissolving the walls of partition between previously siloed disciplines.
        <br> Inspired by the writings of Thomas Merton (ecumenism), Teilhard de Chardin (synthesis), Thomas Berry (ecotheology), and others, his objective is to tell a new, future-looking story for the Ecozic Age, one that forms a connecting bridge between the biblical story of creation, modern science, and ancient cosmologies.
