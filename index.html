            There is an unfilled field in the cosmos that holds everything together, and every discipline is a portal to it.
            Science calls it a field of fundamental forces and elementary particles.
            Religion calls it God and accepts it by faith as an impenetratable mystery.
            How can their historically divded perspectives be reconciled?

            In The Ambient Christ, the author proposes a novel paradigm that explains their complementarity as a seamless unity.
            This innovative model provides a new story for an ailing and divided planet in the twenty-first century, and a viable solution to the holy grail quest.

            "There is something to narrow and missing in gospel as it is presented to us.
            In spite of appearences, our age is more religious than ever; it only needs stronger meat"
            <br> ~Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
            <br> <br>
            "A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificance of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by conventional faiths.
            Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge."
            <br> ~Carl Sagan

            We live in an age hungry for a new universe story, a grand cosmology that reconciles the Creation Story with Evolution and scientific understanding with religion.
            Such a narrative would, if credible, would be nothing short of the mother of all cosmologies.
            Call it "The Greatest Story Never Told", a subtitle once considered for this book.
            I like to think big thoughts.
            In the seventh decade of life, I find myself in what Erik Erikson called the Generative Stage, the next to last stage of psychosocial development.
            It is that phase of life when a person is inspired, nay impelled to give something of value in gratitude for the benefit of future generations.
            For a writer, that might involve offering clarity of vision and direction in some way to those who follow.
            I had one book in me, this one.
            This work is an offshoot of the vocation to which I have been called and gifted.
            Every experience in my life, every encounter, success, loss, failure, and experience have in some way led to its making.
            Its content is not for everyone, not even for most, though a few may find it relevant or enlightening.
            It is born of my passionate curiosity about the inner workings of things, whose origin is in deepest nature, the One (singularity) from which I believe all multiplicity and diversity derive.
            In all division, argument, and conflict, all sides are usually dominated more by error than by reality.
            </p>
            <div>
            <p>
            That is because the only reality that could be present, were it present, would prevent or resolve the conflict, dissolve the division, and end the argument.
            There could be no conflict if all participated in that reality and/or the focused intent to pursue same toward that end.
            Deficient by nature in the earnest and peaceful pursuit of same, and inclined to siloed self-referencing, most mortals attempt this by means of argument, each believing his idea is valid.
            Such is a perspective tantamount to looking at a tiny segment of reality through a soda straw, defining the whole by a single part.
            By obersving all division and conflict over a lifetime, none more fervent than between religion and science, it became partially obvious that said reality (the infallible) has yet to be substantively revealed to the other side.
            This book is an attempt to end that conflict, and all human conflicts where differences are preferred, sought, and defended over those of commonality, civility, and union.
            While the grand synthesis proposed herein claims no infallibility, it points in the direction where its mysteries may be discovered in nature and supernature.
            It is the thesis of this book that are far from divided.
            Rather, they are seamless interbeing realities hidden in plain sight, visible to eyes prepared to see them.
            Notions of the inherent interconnectedness and communality of all things are not new, they date to ancient times.
            What is new is the proposed synthesis herein that attempts to explain the “how” of their seamless unity.
            Medievalists spoke of the “Great Chain of Being,” what is now referred to as the ecosystem, Egg of Life, or Circle of Life.
            The chain model is a hierarchy (or continuum), one that preserves the inherent dignity of all things which participate in divine being in various ways, their center and source.
            That center is also their ground of coherence, holding all things together in an enchanted universe.
            This view holds to the notion that once the chain is broken, and just one link not seen or respected as sacred, the vision of its individual sacrality, and place in the whole vision collapses.
            When divinity is not acknowledged in all things, the basis is lost for seeing it in anything.
            Absent that vision, and reality becomes merely one of private preferences, slanted perspectives, and prejudices with no common ground.
            As a result, the Cosmic Egg shatters.

            Bonaventure, medieval theologian and prolific author of spiritual treatises wrote, “God is within all things but not enclosed; outside of all things but not excluded; above all things but not aloof; below all things but not debased.”
            If true, the origin, multitude, activity, order, (and disorder) of all things is the very “fingerprint” and “footprint” (vestigia dei) of the divine of God in creation.
            And in a way that joins all things to itself by a common universal interbeing element; no exceptions, science and spiritually included.
            This book delves into the mystery of that universal interbeing element in which all things consist and hold together.
            And with it the very definition of God, God-identity, and Spirit.

        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p> Joseph C. Masterleo, LCSW-DCSW, is a clinical social worker in private practice in Syracuse, NY and Rockledge, FL.
        His half-century of service in the mental health care field includes faith-based counseling, with an emphasis on psycho-spiritual integration.
        His subspecialty involves developing a novel paradigm for the synthesis of science, religion, and psychology, identifying the energy and geometric patterns that connect the quantum world with space-time.
        His model explains how spirit and matter can co-exist as two facets of one reality in a unified field, dissolving the walls of partition between previously siloed disciplines.
        Inspired by the writings of Thomas Merton (ecumenism), Teilhard de Chardin (synthesis), Thomas Berry (ecotheology), and others, his objective is to tell a new, future-looking story for the Ecozic Age, one that forms a connecting bridge between the biblical story of creation, modern science, and ancient cosmologies.
