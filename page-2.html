                            <p>Highly recommend The Ambient Christ, by Joseph Masterleo. This well researched work does a nice job connecting the Spirit of God through his words and scripture, with the science of light energy, quantum physics and the universe. The book does a wonderful job of relating the wholeness of the spirit world with the light, and electricity of the world of science. For those of you seeking an unifying way to connect science and a spirit world where Christ is everywhere, this book is an excellent place to start.

                            <p>The Ambient Christ: The Inside Story of God in Science, Scripture and Spirituality by Joseph C. Masterleo is a book I have long wanted to read, only it wasn’t written yet. Finally it is here — a brilliantly articulated argument that reconciles science and faith, establishing the logical way in which one complements the other, and demonstrating that one does not necessarily imply the absence of the other. In this book, the author pulls the reader into uncharted waters as he explains the seamless connection between the visible and the invisible worlds, showing with convincing and logical arguments that there is a new synthesis that explains the unity of science and religion. Readers will understand the link between the biblical narrative of creation and science and evolution. This synthesis demonstrates that the material and the spiritual worlds do merge and proposes an intelligent solution to the mysteries of the incarnation and the secrets of the Holy Grail that have never before been revealed. That unity is Christ!

                            There was a period in the Church’s history when the free spirit of scientific inquiry was systematically and ruthlessly stifled, and for centuries, science was considered as opposing religion. The dialogue between science and religion is a recent endeavor, one that was amplified by Pope John Paul II. This book is a giant leap in the direction of that dialogue and Joseph C. Masterleo comes across as a master in the field. The Ambient Christ is well-researched, filled with scientific and historical facts, and observations that are mind-boggling. The author does an impeccable job of uncovering trends and belief systems, capturing the religious climates of the different periods in writing that is fluid and excellent. Some of the observations in this book will have readers rethinking their approach to religion and science. The Ambient Christ: The Inside Story of God in Science, Scripture and Spirituality is a pioneering work that defines the spirituality of the future and establishes the place of Christ in that spirituality; it offers a fresh perspective in understanding the salvific mission of Christ as the unifying principle.

                            <p>The Ambient Christ: The Inside Story of God in Science, Scripture, and Spirituality asserts that perception is everything. Before you say that this is another way to make science and religion come to terms, you need to carefully read through Joseph C. Masterleo’s arguments and proofs. The Western world has a falling out with theological views that trace as far back as the censorship of Copernicus and Galileo. With soft science as the foundation of his studies, Masterleo stresses that there is a widespread disconnect between heart and mind in the Western world, with the paradox that it lives culturally in a scientific age and religiously in the Middle Ages. This book seeks to discover a new cosmology, by finding a more understandable path among the established forces of scientific materialism, religious orthodoxy, and academic psychology. The essentials pertinent to the proposed model are assembled here. 

                            Don't easily assume that Joseph C. Masterleo’s studies will put an end to the debate between science and religion. What emerges in The Ambient Christ is a concentrated effort to reconcile two opposing fields. Given that not everyone is open to accepting the proposed synthesis of science and religion, Masterleo is quite persuasive, and he may well convince you to see it his way. For example, he gives credence to the mathematics of the Golden Ratio, which is a naturally occurring sequence of numbers that can be found everywhere—from the number of leaves on a tree to the shape of a seashell. This contains an essential unity behind all the diverse growth paths and patterns in creation. I can go on and on, but I strongly recommend you to read this book for yourself. In it are available clues that require openness to new ideas that may well reconcile science and religion.

                            <p>Where did it all come from? What am I and why do I exist? How does all nature connect? Are spiritual reality and physical reality two distinct entities or different manifestations of the same force? Joseph C. Masterleo looks at these questions and more in his masterful book—The Ambient Christ. If you are looking for fluff and easy-to-digest reading, this is not the book for you. This book causes you to think about the very existence of matter. It requires you to consider new ways of understanding and thinking. You will want to put on your thinking cap as you delve into the mysteries of the universe and learn the theory of Electric Universe Theory (EUT). To me, this appears to be an extension of the Theory of Everything (TOE). Joseph links the spiritual and the physical through his studies and the theory of quantum physics. 

                            In The Ambient Christ: The Inside Story of God in Science, Scripture and Spirituality, Joseph C. Masterleo brings together the writings and studies of theologians and scientists. For too long, theology and science have been at odds with each other. Joseph reconciles these two fields by showing how they are linked and really are different viewpoints of the same existence. He sees everything as being able to be placed on a spiral continuum. He explains how everything exists as different vibrations of energy. He shares Nikola Telsa, Michael Faraday, Buckminster Fuller, and information from a host of other deep thinkers. Joseph leads his readers from the fundamentals of EUT to a better understanding of how everything in the universe links together and complements each other instead of fighting with each other. His theory, based on his work as well as the works of others, seeks to bring the universe back into harmony.

        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p> Joseph C. Masterleo, LCSW-DCSW, is a clinical social worker in private practice in Syracuse, NY and Rockledge, FL.
        His half-century of service in the mental health care field includes faith-based counseling, with an emphasis on psycho-spiritual integration.
        His subspecialty involves developing a novel paradigm for the synthesis of science, religion, and psychology, identifying the energy and geometric patterns that connect the quantum world with space-time.
        His model explains how spirit and matter can co-exist as two facets of one reality in a unified field, dissolving the walls of partition between previously siloed disciplines.
        Inspired by the writings of Thomas Merton (ecumenism), Teilhard de Chardin (synthesis), Thomas Berry (ecotheology), and others, his objective is to tell a new, future-looking story for the Ecozic Age, one that forms a connecting bridge between the biblical story of creation, modern science, and ancient cosmologies.
